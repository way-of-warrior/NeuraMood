# 🧠 NeuraMood  
### *Real-time EEG Emotion Classification using Deep Learning*  

---

## 🌟 Overview  
**NeuraMood** is a Streamlit web application that classifies human emotions from EEG (electroencephalography) data using a deep learning model.  
It provides real-time predictions, interactive visualizations, and an elegant UI for showcasing EEG-based emotion research.

The project demonstrates:
- EEG data preprocessing & normalization  
- Deep Neural Network for emotion classification  
- Interactive web visualization (confidence bars, radar charts, confusion matrix)  
- A clean, event-ready Streamlit interface with background video and animations

## 🧠 Model Architecture  

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])
```

- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Loss:** Sparse categorical crossentropy  
- **Accuracy:** ~97–98% on test data
